# frame.io OAuth2
Simple frame.io oauth setup with a flask server. This repo just contains the bare minimum required to get an access token from frame.io on a local flask server. You'll need to set up a free frame.io account and create an OAuth2 app in the [developer console](https://developer.frame.io/app/oauth-apps).

The frame.io docs are really vague so setting this up was more painful than it should have been.
